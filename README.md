# Transport Demo

Vahil forgot to attach the assignment data, so I've gone ahead and followed the instructions without it

A login Page with username, password and a login button
After login navigate to “Trips” page where we try to find a trip within the available train timetable
Choose “Date” from a Date Picker/ Calendar
Choose “From” and “To” stations from respective drop down lists
Upon choosing the “To” station, the “Timetable” with all the available departure times for the selected travel should be displayed
By changing any of “From”, “To” or “Date”, the timetable should be updated dynamically.
After selecting the departure time from the timetable, clicking on “Apply” button should run some local application on your computer (anything is works, Open a calculator, a notepad, etc.)
